# Firmware
There are seval firmwares fit Robin Nano:
- [Marlin2.0-For-Robin-Nano](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/Mks-Robin-Nano-Marlin2.0-Firmware)
This repository is based on Marlin2.0.x, added the [LittlevGL](https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl), the colourful GUI. It is developed on PlatformIO, we hope more and more developers will participate the development of this repository.
- [MKS-Robin-Nano](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-Robin-Nano-Firmware)
This is the factory version of the MKS Robin Nano, the performance is most stable, but as the development IDE needs to pay, it is not suitable for individual users to secondary development
- [Marlin2.0-For-Robin-Nano-old-version](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/Mks-Robin-Nano-Marlin2.0-Firmware-old-version.git)
This version is also based on marlin2.0, but the version is relatively old, and the LCD display only supports marlin's native display, no cool GUI. Later, it will be slowly replaced by the version with cool GUI.
